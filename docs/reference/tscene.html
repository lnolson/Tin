<h3>TScene</h3>

<p class="text-muted spacer">Overview</p>
<p>
	TScene provides infrastructure for drawing in a TView. It is expected that you will make a custom subclass of TScene, and provide your own implementation of at least the update method, perhaps setup method.

<div class="ref-property">
	<h5>func <a href="setup">setup()</a></h5>
	<p>
		This method is intended to be overridden in a subclass. Setup is called once, after the view is created, and added to the window. You should not perform any drawing in setup, as the drawing context is not yet ready for rendering. It is a good opportunity for initialization of data or other one time computation. Drawing should happen in the update method.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="ref-property">
	<h5>func update()</h5>
	<p>
		This method is intended to be overriden in a subclass. TView arranges a timer to call update repeatedly with a frequency based on the frameRate property. Put drawing methods here.
